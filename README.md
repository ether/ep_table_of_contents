# Builds a table of contents into the Etherpad interface

Enable under settings.
Create headings, watch the TOC populate in real time.

## Configuration

If you want to have the TOC shown by default, add following snippet to your `settings.json`:

```json
"ep_toc": {
  "disable_by_default": false
},
```

You can also set this on a per-pad basis by setting the URL parameter `toc` to `true` or `false`.
